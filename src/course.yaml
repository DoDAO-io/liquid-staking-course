      DeSci is a movement creating public infrastructure for scientific knowledge through the Web3 stack. 
      It aims to incentivize scientists to share and receive credit for their work, while promoting transparency and accessibility to all.
      This decentralized approach allows for diverse funding sources, accessible data and methods, and incentives for reproducibility.
      It creates a more resistant research model to central authorities and promotes unconventional ideas.

    title: Liquid Staking
    details: >
      Liquid staking is a staking service that allows users to pledge their funds to secure a network while still maintaining access to their funds. 
      This is different from traditional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems, which require users to lock up their assets for a set period of time.
      Users can generate multiple revenue streams from their crypto assets by locking them up and still accessing them. 
      They can use the liquid versions of their assets on other DeFi protocols and earn more on their initial deposits.
