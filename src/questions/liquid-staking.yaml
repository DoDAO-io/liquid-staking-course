  content: What is the difference between traditional Proof-of-Stake (P systems and liquid staking?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: Liquid staking is a staking service that allows users to pledge their funds to secure a network while still maintaining access to their funds. This is different from traditional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems, which require users to lock up their assets for a set period of time.

  content: What are liquid tokens received in liquid staking?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: Liquid staking works by issuing synthetic tokens that represent the staked funds in a 1:1 ratio. These tokens are called liquid tokens or stTokens (such as stETH for Ethereum). Users can stake their funds with a liquid staking protocol and receive an equivalent amount of liquid tokens in return.

  content: What is the main difference between Proof of Stake and Proof of Work?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: Proof of Stake consensus mechanism disincentivizes attacks on the network by selecting validators to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and have locked up as collateral. In other words, the more cryptocurrency a validator holds and locks up, the higher the chances they have to be selected to create a new block and earn rewards. In Proof of Stake, new blockchain transactions are verified by putting tokens "at stake", which can be taken away ("slashed") in the event of fraudulent behavior. This differs from the traditional Proof of Work consensus mechanism, which disincentivizes attacks by requiring a majority of the computing power.

    - B
  difficultyLevel: Low
  choices:
    - content: Proof of Stake requires a majority of computing power, while Proof of Work selects validators based on their stake.
