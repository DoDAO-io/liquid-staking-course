##### What is the difference between traditional Proof-of-Stake (P systems and liquid staking?  

- [ ]  Liquid staking requires users to lock up their assets for a set period of time, while PoS systems do not.
- [x]  Liquid staking allows users to pledge their funds to secure a network while still maintaining access to their funds, while PoS systems require users to lock up their assets for a set period of time.
- [ ]  Liquid staking requires users to pledge their funds to secure a network, while PoS systems allow users to access their funds and earn staking rewards at the same time.
- [ ]  Liquid staking does not require users to pledge their funds to secure a network, while PoS systems do.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Liquid staking is a staking service that allows users to pledge their funds to secure a network while still maintaining access to their funds. This is different from traditional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems, which require users to lock up their assets for a set period of time.

##### What are liquid tokens received in liquid staking?  

- [ ]  Tokens that are highly volatile and not suitable for trading
- [ ]  Tokens that represent physical assets, such as gold or real estate
- [x]  Synthetic tokens that represent staked funds in a 1:1 ratio
- [ ]  Tokens used to pay for gas fees on the Ethereum network
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Liquid staking works by issuing synthetic tokens that represent the staked funds in a 1:1 ratio. These tokens are called liquid tokens or stTokens (such as stETH for Ethereum). Users can stake their funds with a liquid staking protocol and receive an equivalent amount of liquid tokens in return.

##### What is the role of validators?  

- [ ]  To generate synthetic tokens in a 1:1 ratio to staked funds
- [ ]  To store liquid tokens in an escrow smart contract
- [x]  To verify transactions and secure the network
- [ ]  To charge fees for using the platform

##### What is the main difference between Proof of Stake and Proof of Work?  

- [ ]  Proof of Stake requires a majority of computing power, while Proof of Work selects validators based on their stake.
- [x]  Proof of Stake selects validators based on their stake, while Proof of Work requires a majority of computing power.
- [ ]  Proof of Stake and Proof of Work are the same consensus mechanism.
- [ ]  Proof of Stake and Proof of Work both rely on a majority of validators.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Proof of Stake consensus mechanism disincentivizes attacks on the network by selecting validators to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and have locked up as collateral. In other words, the more cryptocurrency a validator holds and locks up, the higher the chances they have to be selected to create a new block and earn rewards. In Proof of Stake, new blockchain transactions are verified by putting tokens "at stake", which can be taken away ("slashed") in the event of fraudulent behavior. This differs from the traditional Proof of Work consensus mechanism, which disincentivizes attacks by requiring a majority of the computing power.

##### What is the minimum amount of ETH required to become a validator in self-staking?  

- [ ]  10 ETH
- [ ]  16 ETH
- [x]  32 ETH
- [ ]  64 ETH
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Becoming a validator on the Ethereum network is a capital-intensive exercise, with a high threshold of 32 ETH.

##### What are the risks associated with centralized exchange staking?  

- [ ]  Lack of transparency
- [ ]  Withdrawal fees
- [ ]  Dependence on a centralized party
- [x]  All of the above
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: The centralized nature of this system comes with risks, such as lack of transparency and trust in a centralized party, and withdrawal fees.

##### What is the primary advantage of staking over traditional yield-bearing savings accounts?  

- [ ]  Lower rewards
- [ ]  Higher risk
- [ ]  No access to funds
- [x]  No intermediaries
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Staking rewards are higher due to the transparent and decentralized nature of blockchain systems, which eliminates the need for intermediaries.

##### What is the penalty for withdrawing funds before the lockup period in locked staking?  

- [x]  Loss of rewards
- [ ]  Slashing of stake
- [ ]  Double fees
- [ ]  Permanent lockup of assets
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Locked staking involves committing to a specific time period to stake tokens or cryptocurrency without withdrawing them. Withdrawing funds before the lockup period results in a penalty or loss of rewards.

##### How can users benefit from liquid staking?  

- [ ]  Users can stake their funds and receive a 1:1 ratio of liquid tokens in return.
- [ ]  Users can earn staking rewards on their initial deposits and generate more funds from their derivative tokens simultaneously.
- [ ]  Users can use their liquid tokens for various purposes, such as lending them on Aave to earn interest or providing liquidity on Uniswap to earn fees.
- [x]  All of the above.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Users can benefit from liquid staking by staking their funds and receiving liquid tokens in return, earning staking rewards on their initial deposits, and generating more funds from their derivative tokens simultaneously. Additionally, users can use their liquid tokens for various purposes, such as lending them on Aave to earn interest or providing liquidity on Uniswap to earn fees.
